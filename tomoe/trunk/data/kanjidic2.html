<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the home page of the KANJIDIC2 project. 
</p>
<p>
The files of this project are copyrighted by the 
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/groups/edrdg/">Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group </a>
and are available under the Group's
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/groups/edrdg/licence.html">licence. </a>
</p>
<p>
The KANJIDIC2 project is aimed at producing a consolidated XML-format
kanji database combining the information currently in the KANJIDIC 
(6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208) and KANJD212 (5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212) files
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic.html">(overview) </a>
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic_doc.html">(documentation), </a>
and adding information about the additional kanji in JIS X 0213.
</p>
<p>
Why do this? Well, XML is a great format for distributing data because many database
packages can import files using XML. Also a growing number of software tools can
handle XML. Many people want to use the data in KANJIDIC
etc. but have trouble handling its format. In addition, I want to take advantage of
the much richer data structure available in XML to add additional information and
features to the database.
</p>
<p>
As with the JMdict project, an internal format is used for storage and
editing, and the XML version is generated from that, as will the
original KANJIDIC/KANJD212 files.
</p>
<p>
The main documentation is in the form of comments in the DTD, however an
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic2/kanjidic2_ov.html">overview </a>
is available. Information about what has changed in each release is in the 
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic2/whatsnew.html">What's New </a>
page.

Don't ask me about it.

<p>
<b>General</b>
</p>
<p>
At this stage the KANJIDIC2 file is officially released, but please understand that
it is still early days for the project and changes in the structure may
occur, so don't assume anything is set in concrete if you use the file in
a project.
</p>
<p>
One major change, which will only be implemented gradually as it will require
a lot of manual work, is to group the readings and the matching meanings.
</p>
<p>
The structure allows for meanings to be in more than one language. There are
sources of material in French, Portuguese and Spanish, which it will be good
to add.
